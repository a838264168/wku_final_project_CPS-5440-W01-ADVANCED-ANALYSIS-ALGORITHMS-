# wku_final_project_CPS-5440-W01-ADVANCED-ANALYSIS-ALGORITHMS-
This project is a secondary development based on Advanced-Shortest-Paths-Algorithms 
(https://github.com/navjindervirdee/Advanced-Shortest-Paths-Algorithms). On top of the original project, I have made the following improvements:
1. Added functionality to randomly generate sparse and dense graphs of different sizes.
2. Added performance metrics visualization, including the generation of bar charts and line graphs for data visualization.

Steps to run Java code
1. set up a new java project(recommend Eclipse, only test on Eclipse)
2. add external library jfreechart
3. download Java code and copy the Java code to the src directory
4. run the codes
